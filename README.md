# Intrusion Detection in CICIoT2023 Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT networks using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The CICIoT2023 dataset is used for model training, evaluation, and testing to detect various types of cyber-attacks on IoT devices.

## Dataset

The dataset used is **CICIoT2023**, which contains a variety of IoT-related network traffic with both normal and attack scenarios. It includes features that help in identifying network intrusions.
